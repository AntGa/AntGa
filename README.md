I'm a penultimate-year Computer Science student at the University of Auckland passionate about game and software development. Currently I'm a software developer for the University Of Auckland's Web Development and Consultation club, working on the Youth Of Orakei website! I'm also a part of RuffByte, an indie game company based in New Zealand.
